## Custom Web and Mobile Application for Poultry Plant

[Src Code](https://github.com/justindbarrett/jbarpoultryapp)

A web and mobile application for all the needs of a local USDA poultry plant including customer tracking, scheduling and lot tracking. This project is an Ionic/Angular based web application that uses Capacitor to create a mobile application that can be deployed on both Android and Ios platforms. This application uses Google Firebase for web hosting and deploying, the backend api using functions and the database. This application is still in development, but there is a small demo below showing some of the current experience in a mobile frame.
